# MATLAB Files for Data From the M:1 Simultaneous Data Transfer Tests

The following files were used for the post processing of the data collected during the M:1 tests. Since the incoming data from the peripherals are all tagged with the peripheral's corresponding label, code was created to organize all the data into columns according to the data's tag. Once organized in a data structure, the data is then analyzed for packet loss.
